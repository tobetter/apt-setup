  * Stop enabling backports by default (Closes: #764982). Rationale:
     - Packages in the base suite are preferred to the ones in the
       backports suite so one needs to specifically ask for the version
       from backports.
     - That isn't true for packages which are only available in the
       backports suite.
    This means one could possibly install such packages without even
    noticing they're not fetched from the base suite; and that seems
    a dangerous default.

  * Add support for CD/DVD sets during installation:
    - rename generator 50cdrom to 40cdrom to make room for new generator
    - add new generator 41cdset to support scanning additional CD/DVDs
    - add script load-install-cd
    To support CD/DVD changing, the installation CD/DVD needs to be unmounted
    in the D-I environment during package installation, which means that e.g.
    running anna-install to install udebs is no longer possible. Because of
    this components/scripts also need make sure that the installation CD is
    loaded and mounted again after package installation.
    Components/scripts that can install packages in /target after apt-setup
    has been run should either use apt-install, or create the correct
    conditions themselves (as pkgsel does).
    Requires apt (0.7.9) in testing for #448187 and #448521, and requires
    pkgsel (1.16) and di-utils (1.50).
  * Add myself as uploader.

apt-setup (1:0.1) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Joey Hess ]
  * First release as a udeb broken out from base-config and rewritten.

  * This means that apt mirror config uses d-i's mirror configs automatically.
    Closes: #220269, #252121, #235980, #251007
  * Issues with /dev/cdrom symlinks no longer apply, since that's taken
    care of by d-i. Closes: #198759, #264375, #274615
  * Issues with CD eject buttons no longer apply, since well, it currently
    only supports loading in one CD. Closes: #215639, #215639, #240331
    Closes: #333513
    (TODO item exists for multiple CDs tho).
  * Runs in the first stage so no issues with it running again and eating
    configured sources or wanting to clear proxy settings.
    Closes: #229048, #196625
  * Will deal nicely with failure to reach security.debian.org.
    Closes: #251413
  * You can enter a mirror manually in choose-mirror and entry proxy info too.
    Closes: #277481, #284794
  * CD stuff works ok in noninteractive/preseeded modes. Closes: #282356
  * Adds deb-src lines for everything, including security updates.
    Closes: #269154.

  [ Colin Watson ]
  * Various small fixes.
  * Call the main package apt-setup-udeb to allow for apt-setup.deb in the
    future.
  * Add translation infrastructure.
  * Set epoch to supersede the base-config-based apt-setup-udeb in Ubuntu.
  * Don't bother looking for security updates for unstable.
  * Strip everything after the first dot from generator names when
    constructing progress template names, to allow writing variants of a
    generator with the same basic purpose as the original.
  * Initial untested mirror generator for Ubuntu. Not added to translation
    infrastructure yet, although the templates are there.
